Lorem $y = 1$ ipsum dolor sit amet, $$y = 2$$ consectetur costs \$5.00 adipiscing elit. `verbatim doesn't get transformed $y = 3$`.

$ mathmode in verbatim doesn't get translated$

$$ same for displaystyle $$

$y = 4$
$$y = 5$$

```
This is a code block and
not an equation $y = 6$, so equations
$$y = 7$$ should not get rewritten.
```

But it ends gracefully $y = 8$ $$y = 9$$.
